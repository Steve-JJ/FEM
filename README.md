## Real-time Finite Element Modelling (FEM)

This repo contains a report summarising an algorithm I developed for real-time
simulation of biological material. It is a generic FEM algorithm using a 
tetrahedral mesh, so can be applied to any deformable material, not just
biological materials.

The algorithm was implemented in CUDA, using a Radau IIA implicit Runge-Kutta
algorithm for solving the differential equations.
